# Welcome to Parallax

Parallax is a decentralized, EVM-compatible blockchain protocol inspired by Bitcoinâ€™s time-tested economic model and secured by XHash Proof of Work.  

This documentation is your primary resource to understand how Parallax works, how to connect to the network, and how to contribute to its ecosystem.

## Documentation Structure

Our documentation is divided into two main sections:

### ðŸ“– The Parallax Protocol

This section explains the protocol itselfâ€”its foundations, architecture, and advanced concepts. Itâ€™s the right place to start if you want to understand **what Parallax is** and **why it works the way it does**.

- **Foundational Topics** â€“ Introduction to Parallax, LAX, accounts, blocks, transactions, gas and fees, and the Parallax Virtual Machine (PVM).  
- **Parallax Stack** â€“ Components that make up the network, how nodes communicate, and how the stack fits together.  
- **Advanced** â€“ Bridges, Tokens standards, Oracles, Networking and Data Structures used in the Parallax protocol.

### ðŸ’» Parallax Client

This section focuses on the official Parallax Client implementation. It covers everything you need to know to install, configure, and run your own node.

- **Getting Started** â€“ Hardware requirements, installation, and first steps.  
- **Fundamentals** â€“ Command-line options, security, sync modes, account management, databases, backups, logs, pruning, config files, and more.  
- **Interacting with the Client** â€“ JSON-RPC server and namespaces, JavaScript console, GraphQL server, and contract interaction.  
- **Developers** â€“ Guides for dApp developers, client developers, PVM tracing, and contributing to the codebase.  
- **Monitoring & Tools** â€“ Node health, metrics, and helper utilities.

## Next Steps

- Start with the **Foundational Topics** under *The Parallax Protocol* to learn the basics.  
- Head to the **Parallax Client** section if you want to run a node or interact directly with the client.  
- Explore the **Developers** resources if youâ€™re building dApps or contributing code.  

Letâ€™s build the future of decentralized infrastructure together.
