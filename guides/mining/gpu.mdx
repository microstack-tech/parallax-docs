If you want better performance than the built-in CPU miner, you can mine with your **GPU** using [Hashwarp](https://github.com/microstack-tech/hashwarp). Hashwarp is a fork of **Ethminer** -- adding support for Parallax Proof-of-Work XHash algorithm -- so existing Ethash miners can be used with only a few adjustments.

## Hashwarp

**Hashwarp** is the official reference GPU miner for Parallax’s **XHash** Proof-of-Work algorithm.  
It is a **minimal implementation** focused on correctness and portability, derived from the original **Ethminer** project but adapted to support the Parallax XHash pipeline.

Currently, Hashwarp supports **OpenCL only**, ensuring it works out of the box on both **AMD** and **NVIDIA** GPUs without requiring CUDA or vendor-specific SDKs.  
This simplified architecture keeps the miner lightweight and easier to audit, while leaving room for the **community to build more advanced and optimized miners** — such as those adding CUDA, Vulkan, or Metal backends and performance tuning.

Hashwarp’s goals are:

- Provide a **reference implementation** of XHash GPU mining.  
- Offer **cross-platform compatibility** through OpenCL.  
- Serve as a **foundation** for developers to experiment, optimize, and build upon.  

If you’re interested in contributing or extending Hashwarp, visit the [official repository](https://github.com/microstack-tech/hashwarp) and explore the source code.

## Prerequisites

- A machine with a **dedicated GPU** (NVIDIA or AMD).  
- Installed GPU drivers (CUDA for NVIDIA, ROCm/AMD drivers for AMD).  
- [VC++ Redist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#latest-supported-redistributable-version) (Windows Only)
- Your [Parallax client](../client/setup) running with HTTP enabled.  
- An account address to receive mining rewards.

## Step-by-step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Hashwarp">
    Download Hashwarp from the official repository:

    - [Hashwarp GitHub Releases](https://github.com/microstack-tech/hashwarp/releases)

    Choose the build that matches your operating system.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start your Parallax client">
    Run your Parallax node with mining RPC enabled:

    ```bash
    ./prlx --http --http.api "eth,net,web3,miner" --mine --miner.coinbase <YOUR_ADDRESS>
    ```

    Replace `<YOUR_ADDRESS>` with the account that should receive mining rewards.

    Leave this running in the background — Hashwarp will connect to it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Hashwarp against Parallax client">
    In another terminal window, point Hashwarp to your local Parallax node:

    ```bash
    hashwarp -P http://127.0.0.1:8545
    ```

    - `-P` specifies the RPC endpoint.  
    - `127.0.0.1:8545` is the local Parallax client.  

    Hashwarp will automatically start mining and submit shares to your Parallax node.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm mining is active">
    Your Parallax client logs should show new work being sealed into blocks.  
    Hashwarp will also display hashrate statistics like:

    ```
    m  15:42:12|hashwarp  Mining on GPU #0: 32.5MH/s
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Where do rewards go?

- Rewards are sent directly to the **coinbase account** you provided in your Parallax client (`--miner.coinbase`).  
- These rewards will be credited to your account once the block you mined reach enough maturity (100 blocks on top of the one you mined).
- You can check your balance with:

```bash
./prlx attach --exec "eth.getBalance('<YOUR_ADDRESS>')"
```

---

## Tips & Troubleshooting

- If Hashwarp shows `no work available`, make sure your Parallax node is fully synced and started with `--mine` flag.  
- If you see connection errors, verify that your Parallax client is running with `--http` enabled.  
- To mine on multiple GPUs, Hashwarp will detect them automatically.
