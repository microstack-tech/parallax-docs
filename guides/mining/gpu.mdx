If you want better performance than the built-in CPU miner, you can mine with your **GPU** using [Ethminer](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer).   Since Parallax uses **Ethash** (with chain-specific parameters), existing Ethash miners can be used with only a few adjustments.

---

## Prerequisites

- A machine with a **dedicated GPU** (NVIDIA or AMD).  
- Installed GPU drivers (CUDA for NVIDIA, ROCm/AMD drivers for AMD).  
- Your [Parallax client](../client/setup) running with HTTP enabled.  
- An account address to receive mining rewards.

## Step-by-step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Ethminer">
    Download Ethminer from the official repository:

    - [Ethminer GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer/releases)

    Choose the build that matches your operating system and GPU.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start your Parallax client">
    Run your Parallax node with mining RPC enabled:

    ```bash
    ./prlx --http --http.api "eth,net,web3,miner" --mine --miner.coinbase <YOUR_ADDRESS>
    ```

    Replace `<YOUR_ADDRESS>` with the account that should receive mining rewards.

    Leave this running in the background — Ethminer will connect to it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Ethminer against Parallax">
    In another terminal window, point Ethminer to your local Parallax node:

    ```bash
    ethminer -P http://127.0.0.1:8545
    ```

    - `-P` specifies the RPC endpoint.  
    - `127.0.0.1:8545` is the local Parallax client.  

    Ethminer will automatically start mining and submit shares to your Parallax node.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm mining is active">
    Your Parallax client logs should show new work being sealed into blocks.  
    Ethminer will also display hashrate statistics like:

    ```
    m  15:42:12|ethminer  Mining on GPU #0: 32.5MH/s
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Where do rewards go?

- Rewards are sent directly to the **coinbase account** you provided in your Parallax client (`--miner.coinbase`).  
- These rewards will be credited to your account once the block you mined reach enough maturity (100 blocks on top of the one you mined).
- You can check your balance with:

```bash
./prlx attach --exec "eth.getBalance('<YOUR_ADDRESS>')"
```

---

## Tips & Troubleshooting

- If Ethminer shows `no work available`, make sure your Parallax node is fully synced.  
- If you see connection errors, verify that your Parallax client is running with `--http` enabled.  
- Use `--opencl` or `--cuda` with Ethminer to explicitly select GPU backend (AMD vs NVIDIA).  
- To mine on multiple GPUs, Ethminer will detect them automatically.
