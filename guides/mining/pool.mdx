Mining on a pool allows you to combine your hashrate with other miners. Instead of waiting to find a block on your own, the pool finds blocks collectively and distributes rewards among all participants. This makes earnings more **regular and predictable** compared to solo mining.

---

## Prerequisites

- Installed GPU mining software such as [Hashwarp](./gpu).  
- An account address to receive rewards.
- The URL of a Parallax mining pool (for example, `stratum+tcp://<POOL_URL>:4444`).  

---

## Step-by-step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a mining pool">
    Pick a Parallax mining pool from the official list (coming soon).  

    Pools usually provide two connection URLs:
    - **Stratum+TCP**: for most miners  
    - **SSL**: for secure connections (optional)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run your miner">
    Use Hashwarp (or another XHash-compatible miner) to connect to the pool.

    Example command with Hashwarp:

    ```bash
    hashwarp -P stratum+tcp://<YOUR_ADDRESS>@<POOL_URL>:4444
    ```

    Replace `<YOUR_ADDRESS>` with your Parallax wallet address.  
    Replace `<POOL_URL>` with the mining pool URL.  
    - No password is required for most pools.  
    - You can add a worker name like `<YOUR_ADDRESS>.worker1` to track multiple rigs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm shares are submitted">
    If everything is working, you’ll see logs like:

    ```
    m  16:12:42|hashwarp  Accepted share #42
    ```

    Each accepted share means your miner contributed valid work to the pool.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check pool dashboard">
    Most pools provide a web dashboard where you can enter your address to see:
    - Current hashrate  
    - Number of accepted shares  
    - Pending rewards  
    - Payout history  
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips & Troubleshooting

- If you see **rejected shares**, check your GPU settings or lower overclocking.  
- Always choose a pool with servers close to your region for lower latency.  
- Make sure your wallet address is correct — rewards cannot be recovered.
