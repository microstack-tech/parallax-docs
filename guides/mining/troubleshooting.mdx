If you're trying to run **Hashwarp** on Windows and see errors like:

```
No OpenCL platforms found
No usable mining devices found
```

it usually means that **Windows cannot locate the NVIDIA OpenCL runtime (nvopencl.dll)** required for GPU mining. This guide will walk you through how to fix the issue manually.

---

## üß© Symptoms

You may encounter one or more of the following:

- `nvopencl.dll` missing in `C:\Windows\System32\` or `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\`
- No `Khronos\OpenCL\Vendors` registry key present
- Tools like `clinfo` showing *no OpenCL platforms*
- Hashwarp not detecting your GPU even though NVIDIA drivers are installed

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Cause

Some versions of **NVIDIA DCH** or **OEM/minimal drivers** do not install or properly register the **OpenCL Installable Client Driver (ICD)**. Without this registration, Windows cannot find the OpenCL runtime ‚Äî leading to Hashwarp failing to initialize your GPU.

---

## ü™ú Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1 ‚Äî Locate the OpenCL DLLs

Run **PowerShell as Administrator**, then execute:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\" -Filter "nvopencl*.dll" -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

Expected output (example):

```
C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\nv_dispi.inf_amd64_xxxxx\nvopencl64.dll
C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\nv_dispi.inf_amd64_xxxxx\nvopencl32.dll
```

If you find these files, note their exact folder paths ‚Äî you‚Äôll need them later.

---

### Step 2 ‚Äî Check if Registry Keys Are Missing

Still in PowerShell, run:

```powershell
Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Khronos\OpenCL\Vendors'
Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Khronos\OpenCL\Vendors'
```

If you see **‚ÄúThe system was unable to find the specified registry key or value‚Äù**, you‚Äôll need to register them manually.

---

### Step 3 ‚Äî Manually Register the NVIDIA OpenCL ICD

Copy and run the following commands in **Administrator PowerShell**, replacing the paths with your actual ones from Step 1:

```powershell
$icd64 = 'C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\nv_dispi.inf_amd64_xxxxx\nvopencl64.dll'
$icd32 = 'C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\nv_dispi.inf_amd64_xxxxx\nvopencl32.dll'

New-Item -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Khronos' -Name 'OpenCL' -Force | Out-Null
New-Item -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Khronos\OpenCL' -Name 'Vendors' -Force | Out-Null
New-Item -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Khronos\OpenCL' -Name 'Vendors' -Force | Out-Null

New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Khronos\OpenCL\Vendors' `
  -Name $icd64 -PropertyType DWord -Value 0 -Force | Out-Null

New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Khronos\OpenCL\Vendors' `
  -Name $icd32 -PropertyType DWord -Value 0 -Force | Out-Null
```

Then **reboot your PC**.

---

### Step 4 ‚Äî Verify After Reboot

After restarting, run the following checks:

```powershell
reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Khronos\OpenCL\Vendors"
clinfo | Select-String "Device Name"
```

Expected output should include something like:

```
Platform Name: NVIDIA CUDA
Device Name: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090
```

If you see this, OpenCL is working ‚Äî Hashwarp should now detect your GPU correctly.

---

### Step 5 ‚Äî Optional: Reinstall the Full Game Ready Driver

If the manual fix doesn‚Äôt persist after a driver update, or fails to register, reinstall the **Standard Game Ready Driver**:

1. Go to [NVIDIA Driver Downloads](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)  
2. Choose **Custom (Advanced)** ‚Üí **Perform a clean installation**  

This reinstalls and registers the OpenCL ICD automatically.

---

### üí° Alternative Option ‚Äî Install CUDA Toolkit Instead

If you **don‚Äôt want to reinstall your NVIDIA drivers**, you can instead install the **[NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)**.  

The CUDA Toolkit package includes the required **nvopencl.dll** and registers the OpenCL runtime automatically during setup.

<Note>
If after installing CUDA Toolkit the OpenCL runtime is still not registered, re-do steps 1, 3 and 4.
</Note>

This method is often quicker and safer if your GPU drivers are already up to date and working fine for gaming or other workloads.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Check

Now you can run Hashwarp again:

```bash
hashwarp -P http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

If everything was successful, you should see output like:

```
m  15:42:12|hashwarp  Mining on GPU #0: 32.5MH/s
```

Congratulations ‚Äî your GPU is now mining successfully on Parallax.
