Mining is how new coins are created and how transactions are secured on the Parallax network. The Parallax client comes with a **built-in CPU miner**, which makes it easy to start mining without installing extra software.

<Note>
CPU mining is mostly for learning and experimentation. For real rewards, you will want to use a GPU miner later.  
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- You have already installed and started the [Parallax client](../installing-the-parallax-client).  
- Your client is synced or actively syncing with the Parallax network.  

---

## Step-by-step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or unlock an account">
    Before you can mine, you need a Parallax account (address) to receive rewards.

    - If you already use [MetaMask with Parallax](../metamask), you can use one of those addresses.  
    - To quickly generate a new account with the client, run:  

    ```bash
    ./prlx account new
    ```

    You’ll be asked to create a password. **Keep this safe!**

    Copy the address that is generated — you’ll need it in the next step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start mining">
    Run the Parallax client with the `--mine` flag and point it to your account:

    ```bash
    ./prlx --mine --miner.coinbase <YOUR_ADDRESS>
    ```

    Replace `<YOUR_ADDRESS>` with the account you created in the previous step.  

    Example:

    ```bash
    ./prlx --mine --miner.coinbase 0x1234abcd...
    ```

    <Note>
    `--miner.coinbase` tells the node where to send mining rewards.
    </Note>
    <Tip>
      If you are using MetaMask, don't forget to include `--http` when starting the Parallax client. You can find more details on the [Setting up MetaMask](../metamask) guide.
    </Tip>
    <Tip>
    You can specify how many CPU threads to use when mining with `--miner.threads N`, where `N` is the number of threads. Set to `0` to use all available threads.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check mining status">
    Once running, the client will show logs about new work being generated and accepted.  

    To confirm mining is active, look for messages like:  
    ```
    Commit new mining work...
    Successfully sealed new block
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Where do rewards go?

- Mining rewards are automatically sent to the **coinbase account** you specified.  
- These rewards will be credited to your account once the block you mined reach enough maturity (100 blocks on top of the one you mined).
- You can view your balance in MetaMask (if using the same account) or with:

```bash
./prlx attach --exec "eth.getBalance('<YOUR_ADDRESS>')"
```

---

## Tips & Troubleshooting

- If your node isn’t syncing, mining will not produce valid blocks. Wait until sync is caught up.  
- CPU mining is slow — don’t expect big rewards. For better performance, look into GPU mining.  
- Make sure your node stays online; if you close the client, mining stops.
