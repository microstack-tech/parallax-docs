# Mining on Parallax

Mining is the process that secures the **Parallax network** and creates new coins. By contributing your computing power, you help validate transactions, maintain the blockchain, and are rewarded with laxes for your efforts.

Parallax uses the **Ethash Proof of Work** algorithm, making it accessible to both **CPU** and **GPU miners**. While CPU mining is a great way to get started, GPU and pool mining provide significantly higher performance and more consistent rewards.

## Why mine?

- **Earn rewards:** Receive coins for helping secure the network.  
- **Support decentralization:** Every miner strengthens the Parallax network.  
- **Learn by doing:** Mining is a hands-on way to understand how blockchain works.
