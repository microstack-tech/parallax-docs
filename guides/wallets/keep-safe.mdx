Your Parallax **account** holds your **coins**. Protecting it is the most important thing you can do.

Unlike a bank, there is **no password reset** — if you lose access to your wallet or share your private key, your funds are gone forever.

This guide explains the best practices for keeping your wallet safe.

## The Golden Rules

- **Never share your private key or seed phrase** with anyone.  
- **Back up your wallet** in a safe place (offline is best).  
- **Beware of scams and fake websites** pretending to be Parallax.  
- **If it sounds too good to be true, it is.**

## Understanding Keys & Phrases

- **Public Address** → Safe to share, others use it to send you LAX.  
- **Private Key** → Controls your funds, must remain secret.  
- **Seed Phrase (12/24 words)** → A human-readable backup of your wallet. Anyone with it can restore your wallet and steal your coins.

## How to Back Up Safely

<Steps>
  <Step title="Write it down">
    When you first create a wallet (for example in MetaMask), you’ll be shown a **seed phrase**.  
    Write it down on paper and store it in a secure location.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make multiple backups">
    Keep at least 2–3 backups in **different safe places** (e.g., safe at home, safe deposit box).  
    Avoid digital-only backups like screenshots or cloud storage — these can be hacked.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Protect your password">
    If you created an account in the Parallax client, you set a password for the keystore file.  
    Back up this password alongside your seed phrase in a secure place.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Security Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Saving seed phrases in Google Drive, Dropbox, or email.  
- ❌ Taking screenshots of your wallet keys.  
- ❌ Sharing private keys in support chats or forums.  
- ❌ Downloading wallets from unofficial websites.

## Advanced Protection

If you plan to hold significant amounts of Laxes:

- Consider using a **hardware wallet** (support coming soon).  
- Run your own Parallax node instead of relying only on third parties.  
- Use a password manager for encrypting and storing backups digitally.
