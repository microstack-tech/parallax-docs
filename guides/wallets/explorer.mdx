The **Parallax Block Explorer** is like a search engine for the blockchain. It lets you see **transactions, blocks, accounts, and balances** directly on the Parallax network.

With the explorer, you donâ€™t need to trust anyone â€” you can **verify everything yourself**.

---

## Why use the Explorer?

- **Check your balance** without relying only on your wallet.  
- **Track transactions** to see when they are confirmed.  
- **View blocks** and see which miner produced them.  
- **Explore the network** and understand how Parallax works behind the scenes.  

---

## Getting Started

Open the official Parallax Explorer in your browser:

ðŸ‘‰ [https://explorer.parallaxchain.org](https://explorer.parallaxchain.org)

---

## Searching for Your Account

1. Copy your Parallax address (from MetaMask or the client).  
2. Paste it into the **search bar** of the explorer.  
3. Press Enter.  

Youâ€™ll see:

- Your **current balance**.  
- A list of **incoming and outgoing transactions**.  
- Your accountâ€™s **transaction count (nonce)**.

## Tracking a Transaction

When you send Laxes, MetaMask gives you a **transaction hash** (a long string starting with `0x`).  

1. Copy the transaction hash.  
2. Paste it into the explorerâ€™s search bar.  
3. The explorer will show:  
   - **Status**: Pending or Confirmed  
   - **Block number**: Which block included your transaction  
   - **From/To**: Sender and recipient addresses  
   - **Amount**: Laxes transferred  
   - **Gas used**  

---

## Viewing Blocks

Click on a **block number** in the explorer to see:

- **Block height** (its position in the chain)  
- **Timestamp** (when it was mined)  
- **Miner** (address that mined it)  
- **Transactions included**  
- **Difficulty and hash**  

---

## Tips

- Bookmark the explorer to quickly check balances.  
- Use the transaction hash from MetaMask to confirm transfers.  
- Remember: if itâ€™s not on the explorer, it didnâ€™t happen on-chain.
