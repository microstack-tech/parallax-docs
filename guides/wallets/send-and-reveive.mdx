---

Once you have a [Parallax account](./accounts) set up, you can start moving coins. This guide will show you how to **send** and **receive** Laxes using MetaMask.

---

## What You Need

- [MetaMask installed and configured for Parallax](../wallets/metamask).  
- An account with some Laxes (either mined or received).  
- The recipient’s Parallax **address** (looks like `0x1234...abcd`).  

---

## Receiving Laxes

To receive LAX, simply share your **public address** with the sender:

1. Open MetaMask.  
2. Copy your address from the top of the wallet screen (starts with `0x...`).  
3. Send this address to the person transferring LAX to you.  

<Note>
It’s safe to share your public address. Only your **private key/seed phrase** must be kept secret.
</Note>

Once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, the balance will appear in your wallet.

## Sending Laxes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open MetaMask">
    Select your account in MetaMask and make sure you’re on the **Parallax network**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Send">
    Press the **Send** button in MetaMask.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter the recipient address">
    Paste the address you want to send LAX to (starts with `0x...`).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter the amount">
    Choose how many **Laxes** you want to send.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set the transaction fee (gas)">
    MetaMask will automatically suggest a transaction fee.  

    Higher fees → faster confirmation.
    Lower fees → slower confirmation.  
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm the transaction">
    Review the details and click **Confirm**.  
    MetaMask will sign and broadcast the transaction.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tracking Your Transaction

After sending:

- MetaMask will show a **pending transaction** until it’s confirmed.  
- You can also paste your transaction hash into the [Parallax Explorer](https://explorer.parallaxchain.org) to see:  
  - Status (pending/confirmed)  
  - Block number  
  - Gas used  
  - Sender & recipient  

---

## Tips & Safety

- Always **double-check the recipient’s address** — blockchain transactions are irreversible.  
- Start with a **small test transfer** if you’re sending a large amount.  
- Keep an eye on your node’s sync status — if your client isn’t synced, balances may appear outdated.
