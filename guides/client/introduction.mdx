# Parallax Client

The **Parallax client** is the official software that allows you to run a full node on the Parallax network.  
It connects to other peers, validates transactions and blocks, and enables you to interact directly with the Parallax blockchain.

Running the client gives you the ability to:

- **Verify the network independently** â€” donâ€™t rely on third parties.  
- **Send and receive laxes** securely from your own machine.  
- **Mine blocks** using CPU or GPU mining.  
- **Expose APIs** for wallets, dapps, or custom applications.  
- **Help decentralize the network** by contributing to peer-to-peer connectivity.
