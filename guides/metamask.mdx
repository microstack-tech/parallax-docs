title: "Setting up MetaMask"
---

[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) is one of the most popular crypto wallets for interacting with blockchains.  

By adding Parallax as a **custom network**, you can use MetaMask to create addresses, manage balances, and transfer Parallax coins (laxes).

This guide will show you how to connect MetaMask to your local Parallax node.

---

## Prerequisites

- You have already installed and started the [Parallax client](./setup).  
- MetaMask is installed in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, or Edge).  
  - If not, download it from [metamask.io](https://metamask.io/download).

## Step-by-step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open MetaMask settings">
    1. Click the **MetaMask extension** in your browser.  
    2. Open the **account menu** (top-right circle).  
    3. Select **Settings** → **Networks**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a custom network">
    Click **Add a network** and then choose **Add a network manually**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Parallax network details">
    Fill in the fields with the following information:

    - **Network Name:** `Parallax Local`  
    - **New RPC URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8545`  
    - **Chain ID:** `2110` for mainnet, `2111` for testnet  
    - **Currency Symbol:** `LAX`  
    - **Block Explorer URL:** (optional) `https://explorer.parallaxchain.org`  

    <Note>
    The `http://127.0.0.1:8545` RPC is provided by your local Parallax client. Make sure your node is running with the `--http` flag enabled.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and switch network">
    After saving, MetaMask will add **Parallax Local** to your list of networks.  

    Select it, and MetaMask will connect to your local Parallax node.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using MetaMask with Parallax

Once connected, you can:

- **Create new addresses**: MetaMask will generate them automatically.  
- **View balances**: See how much laxes each address holds.  
- **Send transactions**: Transfer laxes to other addresses on the Parallax network.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If MetaMask can’t connect, ensure your node is running with HTTP enabled:  

  ```bash
  ./prlx --http --http.api "eth,net,web3"
  ```

- Make sure the RPC URL (`127.0.0.1:8545`) is correct.  
- If using a firewall, check that port **8545** is not blocked.
- If on Linux, make sure to set `--http.addr 0.0.0.0` when starting the Parallax client:

  ```bash
  ./prlx --http --http.addr 0.0.0.0 --http.api "eth,net,web"
  ```

- Some browsers might fail to connect MetaMask to your local Parallax node. This can be fixed by running the client with:

  ```bash
  ./prlx --http --http.vhosts "*" --http.corsdomain "*"
  ```

✨ That’s it! You’re now using MetaMask with Parallax to manage addresses and send Laxes.
