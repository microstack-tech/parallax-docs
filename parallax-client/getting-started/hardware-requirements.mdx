The hardware requirements for running a Parallax node depend upon the node configuration and can change over time as upgrades to the network are implemented. Parallax nodes can be run on low power, resource-constrained devices such as Raspberry Pi's. However, many users will choose to run nodes on laptop or desktop computers.

## CPU

It is preferable to use a quad-core (or dual-core hyperthreaded) CPU. The Parallax client supports a wide range of architectures.

## Memory

It is recommended to use at least 4GB RAM.

## Disk space

Disk space is usually the primary bottleneck for node operators. At the time of writing (October 2025), Parallax is in its infancy, a 200GB SSD is recommended for a full node running the Parallax client. Archive nodes require additional space. We recommend at least 500GB SSD for a "full" archive node that keeps all state back to genesis. Partial archive nodes can also be created by turning off the garbage collector after some initial sync - the storage requirement depends how much state is saved.

As well as storage capacity, Parallax nodes rely on fast read and write operations. This means HDDs and cheaper SSDs can sometimes struggle to sync the blockchain. A list of SSD models that users report being able and unable to sync the Parallax client is available in this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/yorickdowne/f3a3e79a573bf35767cd002cc977b038). Please note that the list has _not_ been verified by the Parallax team.

## Bandwidth

It is important to have a stable and reliable internet connection, especially for running a validator, because downtime can result in missed rewards or penalties. It is recommended to have at least 25Mbps download speed to run a node. Running a node also requires a lot of data to be uploaded and downloaded so it is better to use an ISP that does not have a capped data allowance.
