A Parallax node continually reports messages to the console allowing users to monitor Parallax's current status in real-time. The logs indicate when the Parallax client is running normally and indicates when some attention is required. However, reading these logs can be difficult for new users. This page will help to interpret the log messages to better understand what the Parallax is doing.

Note that there are a large number of log messages covering a wide range of possible scenarios for a Parallax node. This page will only address a subset of commonly seen messages. For more, see the [Parallax GitHub](https://github.com/microstack-tech/parallax/). Log messages are usually sufficiently self-describing that they do not require additional explanation.

## Configuring log messages

Log messages are displayed to the console by default. The messages can be tuned to be more or less detailed by passing `--verbosity` and a value between `0` and `5` to the Parallax client at startup:

```
0 = silent (no log messages)
1 = error (error messages only)
2 = warn (error messages and warnings only)
3 = info (error messages, warnings and normal activity logs)
4 = debug (all info plus additional messages for debugging)
5 = detail (all info plus detailed debugging messages)
```

The default is `--verbosity 3`.

Log messages can also be redirected so they are saved to a text file instead of being displayed in the console. In Linux the syntax `>> <path> 2>&1` redirects both `stdout` and `stderr` messages to `<path>`. For example:

```sh
# saves detailed logs to path/prlx.log
prlx --verbosity 5 >> /path/prlx.log 2>&1
```

### Startup

When the Parallax client starts up it immediately reports a fairly long page of configuration details and status reports that allow the user to confirm the Parallax client is on the right network and operating in its intended modes. The basic structure of a log message is as follows:

```sh
MESSAGE_TYPE [MONTH-DAY][TIME] MESSAGE VALUE
```

Where `MESSAGE_TYPE` can be `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR` or `DEBUG`. These tags categorize log messages according to their purpose. `INFO` messages inform the user about the Parallax client's current configuration and status. `WARN` messages are for alerting the user to details that affect the way the Parallax client is running. `ERROR` messages are for alerting the user to problems. `DEBUG` is for messages that are relevant to troubleshooting or for developers working on the Parallax client.

The messages displayed on startup break down as follows:

```

The logs above show the user that the node is connecting to Parallax testnet and some low level configuration details. The cache size is bumped to the Testnet default (4096). The maximum peer count is the highest number of peers this node is allowed to connect to and can be used to control the bandwidth requirements of the node.

```

### Syncing

The default for the Parallax client is to sync in snap mode. The client requests block headers from its peers that are parents of the target until there is a continuous chain of sequential headers of sufficient length. Then, the Parallax client requests block bodies and receipts for each header and simultaneously starts downloading state data. This state data is stored in the form of a [Patricia Merkle Trie](../../parallax-protocol/advanced/data-structures/patricia-trie). Only the leaves of the trie are downloaded, the full trie structure is then locally regenerated from the leaves up. Meanwhile, the blockchain continues to progress and the target header is updated. This means some of the regenerated state data need to be updated. This is known as *healing*.

Assuming the Parallax client has some peers it will start importing headers, block bodies and receipts. The log messages for data downloading look as follows:

```
INFO [07-28|10:29:49.681] Block synchronisation started
INFO [07-28|10:29:50.427] Imported new block headers               count=1    elapsed=253.434ms number=12,914,945 hash=ee1a08..9ce38a
INFO [07-28|10:30:00.224] Imported new block receipts              count=64   elapsed=13.703s   number=12,914,881 hash=fef964..d789fc age=18m5s     size=7.69MiB
INFO [07-28|10:30:18.658] Imported new block headers               count=1    elapsed=46.715ms  number=12,914,946 hash=7b24c8..2d8006
INFO [07-28|10:30:21.665] Imported new state entries
```

For state sync, the Parallax client reports when the state heal is in progress. This can take a long time. The log message includes values for the number of `accounts`, `slots`, `codes` and `nodes` that were downloaded in the current healing phase, and the pending field is the number of state entires waiting to be downloaded. The `pending` value is not necessarily the number of state entries remaining until the healing is finished. As the blockchain progresses the state trie is updated and therefore the data that need to be downloaded to heal the trie can increase as well as decrease over time. Ultimately, the state should heal faster than the blockchain progresses so the node can get in sync. When the state healing is finished there is a post-sync snapshot generation phase. The node is not in sync until the state healing phase is over. If the node is still regularly reporting `State heal in progress` it is not yet in sync - the state healing is still ongoing.

```
INFO [07-28|10:30:21.965] State heal in progress                   accounts=169,633@7.48MiB  slots=57314@4.17MiB    codes=4895@38.14MiB nodes=43,293,196@11.70GiB pending=112,626
INFO [09-06|01:31:59.885] Rebuilding state snapshot
INFO [09-06|01:31:59.910] Resuming state snapshot generation root=bc64d4..fc1edd accounts=0 slots=0 storage=0.00B dangling=0 elapsed=18.838ms
```

The sync can be confirmed using [eth.syncing](../../parallax-protocol/parallax-stack/apis/json-rpc) - it will return `false` if the node is in sync. If `eth.syncing` returns anything other than `false` it has not finished syncing. Generally, if syncing is still ongoing, `eth.syncing` will return block info that looks as follows:

```json
> eth.syncing
{
  currentBlock: 15285946,
  healedBytecodeBytes: 991164713,
  healedBytecodes: 130880,
  healedTrienodeBytes: 489298493475,
  healedTrienodes: 1752917331,
  healingBytecode: 0,
  healingTrienodes: 1745,
  highestBlock: 16345003,
  startingBlock: 12218525,
  syncedAccountBytes: 391561544809,
  syncedAccounts: 136498212,
  syncedBytecodeBytes: 2414143936,
  syncedBytecodes: 420599,
  syncedStorage: 496503178,
  syncedStorageBytes: 103368240246
}
```

There are other log messages that are commonly seen during syncing. For example:

```sh
WARN [09-28|11:06:01.363] Snapshot extension registration failed
```

This warning is nothing to worry about - it is reporting a configuration mismatch between the node and a peer. It does not mean syncing is stalling or failing, it simply results in the peer being dropped and replaced.

## Transaction logs

Transactions submitted over local IPC, Websockets or HTTP connections are reported in the console logs. For example, a simple transaction appears in the console logs as follows:

```sh
INFO [09-06|01:31:59.910] Submitted transaction             hash=0x2893b70483bf1791b550e5a93763058b0abf7c6d9e6201e07212dbc64d4764532 from: 0xFB48587362536C606d6e89f717Fsd229673246e6 nonce: 43 recipient: 0x7C60662d63536e89f717F9673sd22246F6eB4858 value: 100,000,000,000,000,000
```

Other user actions have similar log messages that are displayed to the console.

## Common warnings

There are many warnings that can be emitted by the Parallax client as part of its normal operation.

```sh
WARN [10-03|18:00:40.413] Unexpected trienode heal packet          peer=9f0e8fbf         reqid=6,915,308,639,612,522,441
```

The above is often seen and misinterpreted as a problem with snap sync. In reality, it indicates a request timeout that may be because I/O speed is low. It is usually not an issue, but if this message is seen very often over prolonged periods of time it might be rooted in a local connectivity or hardware issue.

```sh
WARN [10-03 | 13:15:56.543] Dropping unsynced node during sync    id = e2fdc0d92d70953 conn = ...
```

This message indicates that a peer is being dropped because it is not fully synced. This is normal - the necessary data will be requested from an alternative peer instead.

## Summary

There are a wide range of log messages that are emitted while the Parallax client is running. The level of detail in the logs can be configured using the `verbosity` flag at startup. This page has outlined some of the common messages users can expect to see when the Parallax client is run with default verbosity, without attempting to be comprehensive.
