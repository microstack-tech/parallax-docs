Welcome to the Parallax client Developer docs!

This section includes information for builders. If you are building decentralized apps on top of Parallax, head to the dapp-developer docs. If you are developing the Parallax client itself, explore the client developer docs.

## Dapp developers

The Parallax client has many features that support dapp developers. There are many built-in tracers implemented in Go or Javascript that allow developers to monitor what is happening in the Parallax client from inside an app, and users can build their own custom tracers too. The Parallax client also includes a suite of tools for interacting with Parallax smart contracts using the Parallax client functions using Go functions inside Go native applications.

## Parallax client developers

The Parallax client developers add/remove features and fix bugs in the client. The Parallax client developer section includes contribution guidelines and documentation relating to testing and disclosing vulnerabilities that will help you get started with working on the Parallax client.

## EVM tracing

Tracing allows developers to analyze precisely what the EVM has done or will do given a certain set of commands. This section outlines the various ways tracing can be implemented in the Parallax client.
