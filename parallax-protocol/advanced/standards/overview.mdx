## Introduction

Many Parallax development standards focus on token interfaces. These standards help ensure smart contracts remain composable, so for instance when a new project issues a token, that it remains compatible with existing decentralized exchanges.

## Prerequisites

* [Smart contracts](../../parallax-stack/smart-contracts.md)

## Token Standards

Here are some of the most popular token standards on Parallax:

* [ERC-20](./erc-20) - A standard interface for fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like voting tokens, staking tokens or virtual currencies.
* [ERC-721](./erc-721) - A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, like a deed for artwork or a song.
