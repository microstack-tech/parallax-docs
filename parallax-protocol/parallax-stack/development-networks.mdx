When building a Parallax application with smart contracts, you'll want to run it on a local network to see how it works before deploying it.

Similar to how you might run a local server on your computer for web development, you can use a development network to create a local blockchain instance to test your dapp. These Parallax development networks provide features that allow for much faster iteration than a public testnet (for instance you don’t need to deal with acquiring Laxes from a testnet faucet).

## Prerequisites

You should understand the [basics of the Parallax stack](./introduction-stack) before diving into development networks.

## What is a development network?

Development networks are essentially Parallax clients designed specifically for local development.

**Why not just run a standard Parallax node locally?**

You _could_ run a node but since development networks are purpose-built for development, they often come packed with convenient features like:

* Deterministically seeding your local blockchain with data (e.g. accounts with LAX balances)
* Instantly producing blocks with each transaction it receives, in order and with no delay
* Enhanced debugging and logging functionality

## Available tools

Since Parallax is based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine and RPC, much of the Ethereum tooling can also be used with our smart chain.

**Note**: Most [development frameworks](./development-frameworks) include a built-in development network. We recommend starting with a framework to set up your local development environment.

### Ganache

Quickly fire up a personal Ethereum blockchain which you can use to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates.

Ganache provides both a desktop application (Ganache UI), as well as a command-line tool (`ganache-cli`). It is part of the Truffle suite of tools.
